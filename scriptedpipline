##### 1st difference job will get executed build phase but not test phase as it has error 123 is nnot in quotes
node{
    stage("Build"){
        echo "Building"
    }
    stage("test"){
        echo 123
    }
}

###but declartive pipeline will fail intially only it will check whole validation if correct it will execute otherse it will fail intially only.
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage("Build"){
            steps{
                echo "Building"
            }
        }
        stage("test"){
            steps{
                echo "123"
            }
        }
    }
}


####
scripted pipeline will not allow you to start at one stage but declrative allows  you to restart at ay stage like post deploymet steps
